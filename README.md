# USWDS Penpot Design Template
Welcome to the USWDS Penpot Design Template project! This initiative aims to provide designers with a comprehensive, open-source design system template based on the United States Web Design System (USWDS). By leveraging Penpot's powerful design and prototyping capabilities, along with Tokens Studio for managing design tokens, we aim to create a robust toolkit that promotes accessibility, consistency, and usability in government digital services.

## About the Project
The USWDS Penpot Design Template is a collaborative effort to bring the true nature of design tokens into the design workflow. Our goal is to offer a set of pre-built components and design tokens that align with USWDS standards, enabling designers to create accessible and user-friendly web interfaces efficiently.

## Key Features
- **USWDS-Based Components**: A collection of UI components such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars built to USWDS specifications.
- **Design Tokens Integration**: Utilizing Tokens Studio to manage and apply design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and more.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: An open invitation for designers and developers to contribute, share feedback, and help improve the template.

## Get Involved
We invite you to explore the repository, review our backlog, and contribute to the project. Your input and collaboration are crucial to making this design template a valuable resource for the community.
